Agreed, it's still no urgent problem.

So now taking a quick look through the series, I find this approach is
the way to go.  Although one might get a bit more optimization after
squeeze, it's already a good compromise between the readability and
the efficiency.

A slight uncertain implementation is the timer tread stuff, especially
the conditional definition of SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_TREAD (IIRC, I already
complained it in the past, too).  But I have no other idea as well, so
unless someone else gives a better option, we can live with that.


Thanks!
