Thank you for copying me in.

I would love to support Pioneer devices under Linux ("fully"). I.e:
	for DJM mixers: the ability to use audio and midi IO with ALSA
	and by extension pulse/pipewire/JACK and so on. This is my bias.

I'm partial to things just workingâ„¢ so would prefer it to be a kernel
module but the inclusion in-tree is not for me to say.

Lets continue this discussion on the Mixxx chat for now.

Kind regards,
Olivia

But they do not; Rekordbox does it at the application level. Mixxx users are currently unable to use the phono inputs of these devices regardless of OS (see https://mixxx.discourse.group/t/pioneer-djm-250-mk2/17001/29 ). The best way to implement this would be through Mixxx's MIDI controller mapping system so that it works across Linux, Windows, and macOS.

The sent messages should be injected and intermixed with normal messages coming from user-space. The kernel should not claim exclusive access to the MIDI device, because user-space tools might want to use it too.
