Yes, maybe it is not needed *for now*, but will be issue in the future,
because I can't have normal-link and DPCM-link in the same time, right ?

The difference between "-cc" and "card2" is DPCM link detection.
"-cc-"  will assume all are DPCM link,
"card2" will detect both normal-link and DPCM-link via DT.

But, I guess new driver 1st version is focus to
detecting normal-link and DPCM-link only.

This means it is not enough for your case,
because I can't full reproduce your board/situation.
Maybe you need some extra patch on "card2"
which "-cc-" added to soc-xxx.c

Thank you for your help !!

Best regards
