This looks to duplicate a bunch of the same things that a number of
different google developers have posted recently.  Please work with them
to come up with a unified set of patches that you all can agree with,
AND get them to sign off on the changes before resubmitting them.

This uncoordinated drip of patches from different people doing the same
thing is almost impossible to review from our side, as I'm sure you can
imagine.

That being said, thank you finally for at least submitting all of the
needed changes together as one patch set.  That's a first, and something
we had been asking for for years.

Have a good holiday break,

greg k-h
