As mentioned in the thread, PA just picks up the stream that is
connected via a monitor by checking / notified by the corresponding
Jack control.  On hdac_hdmi driver, the jack control has different
base name that is irrelevant with the output pins, so PA doesn't know
how to interpret it, hence it's ignored.
