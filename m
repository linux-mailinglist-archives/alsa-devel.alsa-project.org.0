Well, the ML itself is right, but there is not many things the
developers can help remotely.  This is a very vendor-specific stuff,
no generic problem, hence it's only the hardware vendor who knows how
to fix the problem (most likely some missing extra initialization).
Alternatively, you can do trial-and-error by yourself, e.g. applying
the existing quirks via model option or fiddling with the pin
configurations via hdajackretask.
