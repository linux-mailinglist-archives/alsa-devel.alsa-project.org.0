It sounds too hackish and fragile to me...  Do we need to repeat each
5 seconds?  Wouldn't it suffice to touch only once at setting up the
stream (or need before or after the stream start), instead?

If it's enough to be once in the stream setup, we may add something in
snd_usb_set_format_quirk() that is specific to your device to set the
current mixer value again.

In anyway, alsa-info.sh output would be helpful.

Takashi
