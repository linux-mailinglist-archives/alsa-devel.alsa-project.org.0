The trace infra is indeed a direction which would help on new hardware,
architecture bringup.

I should have used different subject for the cover letter as the end
result is to have better quality bug reports from users in the unlikely
event that something goes wrong (mostly on the firmware side).

To speed up the turnaround to get it fixed as the first report should
contain enough details to hint us where to look.

At the end the series will actually reduce the noise from dev_err() in
case of a failure by printing only needed information without repetition.
