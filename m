But this will keep the power of the graphics chip on, and that's what
the patch was supposed to "fix".

For nouveau, the best fix is to merge the audio component patch.
This will make things working without fiddling with the power
up/down.  The patch has been pending over months under review in DRM
side, unfortunately...  Please pinging them for driving ahead.

For Nvidia, though, it's no path a binary-only stuff can go with, due
to the GPL symbol of the component framework.  Those guys know of it
well, and they seem adding the temporary power up/down procedure by
poking the proc file from the user-space side at the HDMI connection.

About a module option: I don't think it's much better than the sysfs
toggle.  You can set up a simple udev rule if needed, too.


thanks,
