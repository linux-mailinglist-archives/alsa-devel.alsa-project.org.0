The runtime->dma_buffer_p->bytes is assured to be page-aligned by the
change in pcm_memory.c in this patch.  But it's true that non-standard
allocations won't cover the whole pages...

OK, how about the following instead?
Just check SNDRV_PCM_INFO_MMAP in runtime->info; if this is set, the
buffer size must be aligned with the page size, and we are safe to
extend the size to clear.

So the revised fix is much simpler, something like below.
