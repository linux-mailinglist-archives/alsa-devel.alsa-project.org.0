Well, we cannot know whether the replacement really happens or
happened, and hence we never kill the old one.  That's the problem.

My argument is that we're trying to add too much freedom just for this
"marginal" problem.  Honestly speaking, I would feel rather more
comfortable if it were a kernel control element that just does trigger
the LED like the original patch from AMD guys.  Then you cannot do
much wrong.  OTOH, creating a virtual capture switch and let alsa-lib
handling the software mute, while PA should ignores the soft-mute but
dealing only with the assigned mute LED...  Sounds too complex to me.
