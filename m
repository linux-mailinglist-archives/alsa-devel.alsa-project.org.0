My thought was about the devres release that does kfree() of the card
while the card's card_dev release itself is still delayed.
This might be a needless fear, though, as snd_card_free() should sync
with the actual card_dev release.

But, splitting the release-trigger and the actual memory release could
be still worth.

I quickly worked on and made a patch series.
It's put in topic/dev-split branch of sound git tree
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound.git/log/?h=topic/dev-split

It'd be appreciated if you can review / test it.

I'll submit the patch set once (likely in tomorrow) after running a
quick smoke test.
