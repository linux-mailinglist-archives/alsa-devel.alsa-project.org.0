If a physical port supports DP-MST, does the 3 connections on this 
physical port share a single converter? And each connection has an 
independent pcm,Â  maybe the driver should create pcm pool according to 
num_converter * 3.

Let's do some change on TGL first, let us see if it will break some 
user-space apps, then we could evaluate how to handle it.
