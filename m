And now looking back at kobj code and device code, they do refcount
parent objects.  Maybe the problem is in our side -- the all devices
are created with the original real device as the parent, including the
card_dev, while there are some dependencies among children.  So, if we
build up a proper tree, pci_dev -> card_dev -> ctl_dev, pcm_dev, etc,
one of the problems could be solved.  It's more or less similar as
what I suggested initially (referring card_dev at pcm), while changing
the parent would make it implicitly.
