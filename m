This is true in anyway for the legacy HD-audio, too.

I don't think this can be a problem.

Practically seen, the number of PCMs could be just 3 on Skylake and
co, even with DP MST, because i915 can drive only up to 3 monitors.
The driver *should* receive the unplug event before the plug event to
a new monitor, so hda_detach_hda_pcm() gets called before
hda_attach_hda_pcm().

The current patch_hdmi.c implementation is based on the theoretical
possibility, and limitation to the reduced PCM streams would work, I
suppose.
