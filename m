Yes, that sounds like the only way...

One way would be to avoid the buffering in the driver completely.
This also includes to disable the mmap buffer access, of course.

In this alternative way, you'd need to implement copy, copy_kernel and
silence ops, for the copy operation, so the whole buffering is done in
the driver side as you like.  But if the chip clears the DMA buffer,
then you'd need to anyway do some workaround by copying & restoring
the data, so I don't think the alternative way would be worth for
consideration :)
