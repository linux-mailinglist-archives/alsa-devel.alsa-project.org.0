But what gives a benefit?  It needs more plumbing between codec and
machine driver.  The i2c probe doesn't give the irq, so you'd need and
extra stuff to enable the irq in a different route if you'd need to
implement the handler in the codec driver.

Actually, my latest patchset already eliminates the exported stuff by
moving to set_jack callback like some other drivers do.  If you have
an idea for further simplification / fixes, let me know.

I haven't submitted because of the merge window.  The patch is found
at topic/soc-cx2072x-5.2 branch, the commit is
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound.git/commit/?h=topic/soc-cx2072x-5.2&id=ca7f4eee5ecbefcf347f5a4984c0a17629360186
