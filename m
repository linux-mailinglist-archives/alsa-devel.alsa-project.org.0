Is the PA breakage still seen in the very latest kernel?  There have
been a few issues due to the changes but they should have been already
covered.

Apart from that, the choice of implicit feedback was taken at the
commit 5e35dc0338d8 in a few years ago for UFX1024.  I don't remember
the details, but judging from the lsusb output, the devices don't look
like a typical device that requires the implicit feedback (that has
usually ASYNC for both directions).  So, as long as it's confirmed
that the proper clock selector setup fixes the problem, we can drop
the implicit feedback quirks.

However, it's better to split the patches; one for the fix for the
missing clock selector setup, another is the drop of the implciit fb
quirk for Behringer devices.

In anyway, let's see whether the fix works for others.  Then we can go
forward and apply the fixes to the upstream.


thanks,

Takashi
