As you requested, I have now performed such testing.

Results:

Seq - idle: 5.0 ms

Seq - hackbench: 1.3 s (yes, above one second)

Raw + framing - idle: 2.8 ms

Raw + framing - hackbench: 2.8 ms

Setup / test description:

I had an external midi sequencer connected through USB. The system under 
test was a Celeron N3150 with internal graphics. The sequencer was set 
to generate note on/note off commands exactly 10 times per second.

For the seq tests I used "arecordmidi" and analyzed the delta values of 
resulting midi file. For the raw + framing tests I used a home-made 
application to write a midi file. The monotonic clock option was used to 
rule out differences between monotonic and monotonic_raw. The result 
shown above is the maximum amount of delta value, converted to 
milliseconds, minus the expected 100 ms between notes. Each test was run 
for a minute or two.

For the "idle" test, the machine was idle (running a normal desktop), 
and for the "hackbench" test, "chrt -r 10 hackbench" was run a few times 
in parallel with the midi recording application (which was run with 
"chrt -r 15").

I also tried a few other stress tests but hackbench was the one that 
stood out as totally destroying the timestamps of seq midi. (E g, 
running "rt-migrate-test" in parallel with "arecordmidi" gave a max 
jitter value of 13 ms.)

Conclusion:

I still believe the proposed raw + framing mode is a valuable 
improvement in the normal/idle case, but even more so because it is more 
stable in stressed conditions. Do you agree?

If so, I'll send out a v4 with 32 byte framing (16 byte header, 16 byte 
data).
