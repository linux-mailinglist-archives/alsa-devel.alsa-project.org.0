It was just joking; you basically moved the place to stamp the
incoming data from one place (at the delivery center of a sequencer
event) to another earlier place (at the irq handler).

The question is: how much time difference have you measured by this
move?

Let's evaluate a bit what would be the best fit.  I see no big reason
to rush the merge right now.
