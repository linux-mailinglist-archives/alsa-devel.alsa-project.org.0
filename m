Removing the user-space API is absolutely no-go.  The only exception
would be either the case really no one uses it or it's too buggy and
unfixable.

The experience tells us that users are creative enough to (ab)use a
new ABI in any unexpected ways, and we have no control for it.  So
it's not about how alsa-lib is implemented but rather how ABI could be
abused :)
