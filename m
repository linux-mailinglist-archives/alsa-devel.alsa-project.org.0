If here ret==0, hdac_keep_power_up() should return -1, and it's the
return value of codec_pm_lock().  So it must print out the value of
"x" (pm_runtime_suspend() result), but I don't see it.
What's the missing piece...?

I guess it's in the auto-suspend state, so it's still not suspended
but the device itself is active, while the usage count is 0.

That's fine, and I thought my second patch handling it.  That is, if
the usage count is 0 and the device is not suspended, it should return
-EAGAIN and make the caller retry with the full power up.
The code path is with CALL_RUN_FUNC() macro in hdac_regmap.c, and with
-EAGAIN return value, it tries snd_hdac_power_up_pm() and call the
function again.

It's also expected, per se.  Since it's been not suspended, it assumes
that the value got already written, and no resume is needed.
