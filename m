OK, I worked on this further and converted the whole mute LED handling
with LED classdev.

The topic/hda-micmute-led branch was updated again.  Could you give it
a try?  If that's OK, I'll add your tested-by tag and submit the
patches to ML later.

The old patchset is saved in topic/hda-micmute-led-old branch just for
a reference.
