Are the all running processes stopped before entering rescan_prepare
callback?  Otherwise, e.g. a process accessing PCM stream via mmap can
run without ioctl and this may trigger the PCM period elapsed
eventually.  Similarly, a control interface may issue the verb that is
processed via CORB/RIRB, too.  So what you need to cover is not only
about PCM.

But a hot-plugged device can't have any running files, no?
So at which timing is the BAR movement _must_ happen?

And, even if we need some synchronization, the current lock
implementation looks fragile to me.  We likely overlook something when
trying to cover each branch code path.

Basically it needs to wait until all running processes via PCM or
control API are released.  We have a mechanism to block the new opens
like snd_hda_lock_devices().  We'll need an additional stuff to wait
until all opened devices are released there, and this requires some
help in the core code, I suppose.
(Actually this hackish lock_devices/unlock_devices should have been in 
 the core stuff from the beginning...)
