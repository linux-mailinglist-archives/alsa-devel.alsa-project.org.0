OK, I'll check your previous series again, but my gut feeling is for
pursuit to the hw_constraints hacks.  e.g. we may split
snd_pcm_hw_constraints and snd_pcm_hw_rule, too, if that matters.

Ah, right, I overlooked that part...  It's confusing.  Maybe it's in
that style just because it falls back to SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV?
It's another discussion, in anyway.


thanks,
