Thanks for the patches and the analysis.

So, judging from the experiments above, outqueue=1 has no measurable
performance regression?  For 4 ports, it's even an improvement.
Then we may change the default value.

I guess you kept the old value just to be conservative, but if the
number tells a better story and it's no part or ABI, we may consider
changing the default for a better performance.

Or, is there any other potential risk by changing this?


thanks,

Takashi
