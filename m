Now I slowly understand what's happening.  Essentially, it's because
the *embedded* struct device is released asynchronously from the
ALSA's resource management (via dev_free ops).  The objects may be
already released via card's device release (that calls
snd_device_free_all()), while the release of each struct device that
was already triggered beforehand can be delayed due to the debug
option.

You code change looks mostly fine, but as far as I see,
compress_offload also needs a similar change.  Meanwhile, rawmidi and
hwdep do release the object via device release properly, so those are
fine.  Ditto for sequencer.  And timer is only a global device, hence
it must be fine.

And, I believe we need a bit more detailed patch description.  So,
could you improve the patch description, split the change to each
component (control, pcm and compress_offload), and resubmit?

Also, maybe it's worth to change snd_device_initialize() to take the
release (optional) argument, too, instead of setting it explicitly
afterwards at each place.  Already majority of callers will set own
release callbacks.  This can be done at one more additional patch at
last.


thanks,

Takashi
