Well, but the code path there is the runtime PM resume of the audio
device and it means that GPU must have been runtime-resumed again
beforehand via the device link.  So, it should have worked from the
beginning but in reality not -- that is, apparently some inconsistency
is found in the initial attempt of the runtime resume...
