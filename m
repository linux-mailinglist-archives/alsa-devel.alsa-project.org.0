That's one of my concerns in the recent actions for putting the
hard-coded mute LED controls.  So far, the only usage of led-audio
trigger is HD-audio, and it's enabled only for selected devices and
setups.  OTOH, if we apply the audio-led trigger generically in ASoC
codec driver, it's always done and might misfit; e.g. what happens if
two codecs are present on the system?.

Of course, this implementation would make the integration much easier,
and that's a big benefit.  So I have a mixed feeling and not decided
yet whether we should go for it right now...


thanks,

Takashi
