It's a good question.  AFAIK, that's a long-standing problem, and most
of such devices provide the jack detection via HID, which is,
obviously, a completely different driver.  So, if HID driver actually
creates input devices, we'd need to associate them with the sound card
somehow (likely in user-space).  But I have no clear idea what's the
best approach yet.

Also, I'm not sure whether HID device really gives the right jack
detection event.  A cheap UAC1 device I have here doesn't seem to give
the jack detection but only the mute/volume events, as it seems...

OTOH, there are some UAC2 devices providing the jack detection in the
USB-audio interface, and they seem work as is of now.


thanks,

Takashi
