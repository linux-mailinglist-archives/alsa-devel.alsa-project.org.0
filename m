While it's OK to add the polling support in the core code, I suspect
that the main problem gets solved by setting the write_sync flag as
the commit 2756d9143aa5.  For SOF/SST, you may set the flag
unconditionally since they support only the new chipsets.

I've been traveling (still for the next week), so the further reply
may be delayed.

Takashi
