That sounds like a good idea.

Currently I've almost done for HD-audio rework for 5.4, so feel free
to go ahead.

Agreed.  I guess the biggest difference is the handling of the
DP-MST.  The legacy HD-audio HDMI driver takes a different approach
for DP-MST, namely, it chooses dynamically the pin that is connected
with a monitor.  It's for keeping the compatibility (more or less)
with old behavior; the program just needs to open the device that
corresponds to the notification via jack ctl without fiddling with
other extra routing.

OK, will watch out.
