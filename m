The new PCM ops is exactly for resolving such a thing.  Basically
snd_pcm_period_elapsed() is handled asynchronously, so we need the
synchronization.  For a simpler driver, it's merely synchronize_irq()
call (no matter whether it's a hard-irq or a threaded-irq), but for
drivers that deal with another async mechanism (e.g. USB-audio),
another sync procedure is required.

It's possible that the workaround you've done in SOF can be simplified
by this mechanism, but I didn't take a deeper look at it yet.


thanks,

Takashi
