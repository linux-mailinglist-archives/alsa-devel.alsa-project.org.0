The suggested code change looks OK.  So far, so good...

Ouch, this is painful.  We haven't had any devices that require a
15 bit unsigned format, and maybe we don't want to add it to the
common standard format just for one funky device, either.  Such data
processing could be done in alsa-lib, but for the proper interaction
with the user-space, the kernel should provide some information so
that user-space can process the data accordingly.  However, we have no
proper way defined for it generically, so far.

Maybe an easy way would be to create an alsa-lib external plugin, and
apply it per device.  Jaroslav, could it be done via UCM?

So as a first step, we can merge the patch as is.  The rest needs more
consideration.

In anyway, for merging the patch, it has to be submitted properly in a
right format, especially including your Signed-off-by tag.  Please
refer to Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst for details.
