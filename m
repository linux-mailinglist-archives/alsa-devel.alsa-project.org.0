Yes, that's the part where verifying the altsetting for the given
rate.  The UAC2 device must return the valid altsetting bit mask for
the current rate in the request, but your device didn't seem returning
it.  The code is there for devices like MOTU that have multiple
altsets where each one has one sample rate exclusively.

Check the status in /proc/asound/card*/pcm*/sub*/status.  If the
pointer moves forward and the position is expected, at least the data
feed is done, and the problem must be something else.

What about the capture?  Do you get also only silence?

That's probably no problem, I guess it comes from the code trying to
get the resolution.  The patch below may paper over it.

The flow looks good judging from this log, at least.

The device is configured with the dedicated sync endpoint, but it's
not with the implicit feedback mode.  It's interesting whether the
device behaves differently if you load snd-usb-audio module with
implicit_fb=1 boot option.  I don't expect it working better, but
anyway...
