OK, thanks, I found that amdgpu got bound via component in the dmesg
output, too:

[   21.294927] snd_hda_intel 0000:08:00.1: bound 0000:08:00.0 (ops amdgpu_dm_audio_component_bind_ops [amdgpu])

This is the place soon after amdgpu driver gets initialized.
Then we see later another initialization phase:

[   26.904127] rfkill: input handler enabled
[   37.264152] [drm] PCIE GART of 1024M enabled (table at 0x000000F400000000).

here shows 10 seconds between them.  Then, it complained something:


[   37.363287] [drm] UVD initialized successfully.
[   37.473340] [drm] VCE initialized successfully.
[   37.477942] amdgpu 0000:08:00.0: [drm] Cannot find any crtc or sizes

... and go further, and hitting HD-audio error:


[   38.936624] [drm] fb mappable at 0x4B0696000
[   38.936626] [drm] vram apper at 0x4B0000000
[   38.936626] [drm] size 33177600
[   38.936627] [drm] fb depth is 24
[   38.936627] [drm]    pitch is 15360
[   38.936673] amdgpu 0000:08:00.0: fb1: amdgpudrmfb frame buffer device
[   40.092223] snd_hda_intel 0000:08:00.1: azx_get_response timeout, switching to polling mode: last cmd=0x00170500

After this point, HD-audio communication was screwed up.

This lastcmd in the above message is AC_SET_POWER_STATE verb for the
root node to D0, so the very first command to power up the codec. 
The rest commands are also about the power up of each node, so the
whole error indicate that the power up at runtime resume failed.

So, this looks to me as if the device gets runtime-resumed at the bad
moment?


thanks,

Takashi
