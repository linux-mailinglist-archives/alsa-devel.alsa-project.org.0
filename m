I have a mixed feeling about introducing it in standard.
The power-saving itself is always good no matter whether it's cabled
or not, it's merely a workaround for the problem that couldn't be
fully fixed in kernel side.  So it was provided as an option for users
who really need it.  But it's certainly a feasible option.

OTOH, I still wonder about the cause of the noise on Thinkpad.  In
general, if that comes from the codec power down (the Realtek one),
it's usually fixable in a certain level.  Or if it's at the power down
of the link (power_save_controller option), it's often hard and we
keep the blacklist.

Takashi
