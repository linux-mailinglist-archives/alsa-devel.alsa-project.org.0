You can unregister the devices, i.e. they disappear from the
user-space.  However, the old stream and the belonging objects are
still alive, hence you can't release the resources entirely until the
user-space closes and drops the remaining one.  The completion is
waiting for the release of those remaining handles.  So, if you try to
register again the same objects, it'll conflict.

IOW, it'll be really messy if you try to disconnect and release the
whole resources temporarily and restore again.  I guess the current
best would be to limit a part of components somehow during the
temporary absence.

The temporary stop of a stream isn't well handled in the core API,
admittedly, it's a known problem.  We're considering to introduce a
new state, but it's still under evaluation.
