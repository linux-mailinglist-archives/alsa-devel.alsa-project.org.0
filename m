Hm, we need to check the call pattern, then.  The maxbps passed to
this function was supposed to be the value obtained from
snd_hdac_query_supported_pcm(), i.e. the codec capability.

But, basically this patch wouldn't change any practical behavior.  In
the current code, snd_pcm_format_width() can be never 20 or 24,
because the 24 and 24bit supports are also with SNDRV_PCM_FMT_S32_LE.
That is, the cases 20 and 24 there are superfluous from the
beginning (although the checks of maxbps are still needed).

Instead, what we could improve is:
- Set up the proper msbits hw_constraint to reflect the maxbps value
- Choose the right AC_FMT_BITS_* depending on the hw_params msbits

We may change the query function not to return a single maxbps value
but rather storing the raw PCM parameter value (AC_SUPPCM_*), and pass
it at re-encoding the format value, too, if we want to make things
perfect.


thanks,

Takashi
