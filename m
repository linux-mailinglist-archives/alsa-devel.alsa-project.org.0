The same for openSUSE.  Since CONFIG_SND_SOC_INTEL_BAYTRAIL is
exclusive against SOF and other modern codes, I guess it's quite
unlikely that any recent distros enable it.

I find the action a bit too rushing, too.  OTOH, the old code wasn't
well maintained, honestly speaking.  So, from another perspective,
switching to a new code can be seen as a better chance to fix any
bugs.

Of course, we could keep two stuff parallel, but it's rather
confusing.  And, the HSW/BDW devices that need SST are quite rare and
old, so the impact is limited, I guess.

In anyway, let's cross fingers, and feed back to Cezary ASAP when we
get a regression.


thanks,

Takashi
