After reading this thread I still believe that the mem2mem framework is
a reasonable option, unless someone can come up with a method that is
easy to implement in the alsa subsystem. From what I can tell from this
discussion no such method exists.

>From the media side there are arguments that it adds extra maintenance
load, which is true, but I believe that it is quite limited in practice.

That said, perhaps we should make a statement that while we support the
use of audio m2m drivers, this is only for simple m2m audio processing like
this driver, specifically where there is a 1-to-1 mapping between input and
output buffers. At this point we do not want to add audio codec support or
similar complex audio processing.

Part of the reason is that codecs are hard, and we already have our hands
full with all the video codecs. Part of the reason is that the v4l2-mem2mem
framework probably needs to be forked to make a more advanced version geared
towards codecs since the current framework is too limiting for some of the
things we want to do. It was really designed for scalers, deinterlacers, etc.
and the codec support was added later.

If we ever allow such complex audio processing devices, then we would have
to have another discussion, and I believe that will only be possible if
most of the maintenance load would be on the alsa subsystem where the audio
experts are.

So my proposal is to:

1) add a clear statement to dev-audio-mem2mem.rst (patch 08/16) that only
   simple audio devices with a 1-to-1 mapping of input to output buffer are
   supported. Perhaps also in videodev2.h before struct v4l2_audio_format.

2) I will experiment a bit trying to solve the main complaint about creating
   new audio fourcc values and thus duplicating existing SNDRV_PCM_FORMAT_
   values. I have some ideas for that.

But I do not want to spend time on 2 until we agree that this is the way
forward.

Regards,

	Hans
