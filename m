Well, I see a few points to be revised in this policy:

- If it were actually your oversight, then resending the patch makes
  sense.  But if it's not merged by other reasons?  Silently resending
  a patch can be worse.

  For example, suppose the submitter either overlooked or didn't
  receive a reply or a followup in the thread.  You didn't apply the
  patch because of the reply/followup pointing some problem.  Now, the
  submitter tries to resend the original patch again without asking
  the situation, just because you suggested so in the past.  You'll
  get the problematic patch again, and there is a risk that the patch
  gets merged mistakenly at this time.

- The mail archive (lore.kernel.org) nowadays catches all posted mails
  in a proper manner, and it's pretty easy to fetch.  And, resending
  the whole patch would be even higher volume than replying,
  disconnecting the discussions in the previous thread.

So, I find it's OK to give this kind of warning for educational
purposes to the people who don't know the common practice and send the
patches too frequently.  But for other cases, such a warning doesn't
fit.


thanks,

Takashi
