Normally the device is assigned to the first PCM slot.  And, it'll be
always so, as long as you connect a single device.  In this change, we
don't keep the old empty slot, but just tries to use the previous slot
at first.  So a single device connection always leads to the first PCM
slot.

That said, the slot preservation becomes effective only when multiple
devices are connected and they are on/off at the same time.  In such a
case, the device order may be changed at each screen on/off with the
current code, while this patch allows keeping the order.  Maybe I
should emphasize about the multiple devices in the patch description.

The name string appears actually in the dialog.  But the automatic
switch doesn't happen.  So we need some improvement / fix.

OK, I don't mind either position.
