It might be some other external stuff like an external amp that is
missing.  Often it's managed via GPIO or EAPD (that is controlled by
HD-audio itself), but sometimes via a vendor-specific verb, or even
over a completely different i2c...

In the case of vendor verbs, you can take a look at other quirks for
similar models that touches lots of COEF stuff.
