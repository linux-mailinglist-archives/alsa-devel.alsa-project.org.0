IIRC, we used GFP_ZERO in the past for the normal page allocations,
but this was dropped as it's no longer supported or so.

Also, we clear out the PCM buffer in hw_params call, but this is for
the requested size, not the actual allocated size, hence the padding
bytes will remain uncleared.

So I believe it's safer to add an extra memset() like my test patch.
