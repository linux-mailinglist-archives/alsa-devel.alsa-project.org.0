There is certainly difference, and it might be interesting to see the
dependency on the hardware or on the configuration.  But, again, my
primary question is: have you measured how *your patch* really
provides the improvement?  If yes, please show the numbers in the
patch description.

Sorry, you missed the whole point.  The patch was written for the
latency improvement, and it's a kind of performance stuff.  For such a 
performance change, the major interest is the number the patch
provides (improves).  That's why I asked it.  Without numbers, it's
nothing but advertising myths.

I don't have any strong opinion about sequencer vs rawmidi usage.  If
any of them brings a better performance, that's fine and why not.  We
may improve the implementation of sequencer stuff if it's requested,
too; but all needs to be done per measurement at first (if 4-5ms
latency is found, it's really awful and worth for investigation).

This sounds promising as future-proof, yeah.
