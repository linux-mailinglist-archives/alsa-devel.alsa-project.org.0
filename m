I guess we can check it from the codec ID?  Change the probe function
for Skylake+ codecs to patch_i915_skl_hdmi and co, and set the flag
there.

Yes, it's been the primary knob for years to turn on/off the runtime
PM for HD-audio and other legacy drivers.  This was used by powertop
or some other power-aware daemons and tools, to be toggled dynamically
per the power cable state or such.

And, how the silent stream feature should be seen?
Should it be a system-wide root-only setup or adjustable per user?
Would it be changed often?  Such questions and answers will lead us to
the right direction, I hope.
