Apart from the lack of the Input direction (maybe a bug in the hint
code), the fundamental problem is that the driver cannot tell always
the device type at all for each PCM stream.  It's simply because a
stream may give you any input type depending on the mixer route; it's
the case of HD-audio.  So, the same PCM device may be a mic, or a
headset mic, or a line-in, or whatever.

Sometimes there are dedicated PCM devices for certain inputs, but most
of the PCM streams are generic purpose.
