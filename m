Sakamoto-san's comments made me reconsidering of the situation again.
The user-space access like via sysfs was my original idea when the mic
mute LED issue came up for AMD ACP driver in the past.  One problem is
the permission.  The r/w control over sysfs is for root, and we want
for a normal user.  This might be solvable via loginctl or such and
adding the dynamic permission via ACL.  I didn't investigate enough
yet.
