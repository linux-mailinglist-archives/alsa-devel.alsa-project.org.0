A loop there might be safer to keep, indeed.  That's basically for a
difference kind of race, and it can still happen theoretically.

Though, SOF is with the threaded interrupt, and it's interesting how
the behavior differs.  I can imagine that, if a thread irq is running
while a new IRQ is re-triggered, the hard irq handler won't queue it
again.  But I might be wrong here, need some checks.
