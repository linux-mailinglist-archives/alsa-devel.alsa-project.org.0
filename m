You're confusing Controller and Manager.

A Manager is the same as a 'Link', the two terms are interchangeable. It
makes no sense to refer to a link number for a manager because there is
no such concept.

Only a Controller can have multiple links or managers. And each
Controller needs to be declared as an ACPI device if you want to use the
DisCo properties.

The Managers/Links are not described as ACPI devices, that's a
regrettable design decision made in MIPI circles many moons ago, that's
why in the Intel code we have to manually create auxiliary devices based
on the 'mipi-sdw-master-count' property.

> So the _ADR really is identical for both.

That cannot possible work, even for Windows. You need to have a
controller scope, and the _ADR can then be identical for different
peripherals as long as this ADR is local to a controller scope.
