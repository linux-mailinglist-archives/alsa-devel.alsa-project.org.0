Did you try the latest 5.11-rc kernel?  There have been lots of
changes in USB-audio and this might work better there.

If it still doesn't work with 5.11-rc, please try to enable the debug
option, e.g. boot with snd_usb_audio.dyndbg=+p boot option, plug the
device, and get the kernel logs (at plugging and during the audio
operations).


thanks,

Takashi
