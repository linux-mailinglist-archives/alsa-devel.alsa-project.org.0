It's often done by trial-and-error.  Or sometimes the information can
be extracted from Windows driver *.INI file.
Or you can try hdajackretask program for figuring out those.

At best take a look at HD-audio specification.  You can find easily on
the web.

Those are "pin configuration" values where various attributes like the
jack type, the jack color, etc are embedded.  The HD-audio driver
looks through those configurations and determine the set up based on
them.
