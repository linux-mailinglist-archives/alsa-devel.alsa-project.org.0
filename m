The problem is that the SYNC_PTR64 ioctl itself for non-mmap fallback
is equally buggy due to this bug, too.  So disabling mmap doesn't help
alone.

And, yes, we can redefine ioctl numbers.  But, then, application would
have to be bilingual, as well as the kernel; it'll have to switch back
to old API when running on older kernel, while the same binary would
need to run in a new API for a newer kernel.

Maybe we can implement it in alsa-lib, if it really worth for it.

OK.
