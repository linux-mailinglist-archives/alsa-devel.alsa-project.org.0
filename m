Well, hdac_hdmi is a bit different.  It seems managing the link at
runtime PM.  The link put is called at suspend, while get again at
resume.

What I'm not sure for now is whether it's safe to assume the device
being suspended at the driver removal.  If this is always correct, the
link put should have been called already by runtime suspend at removal
time.

Still the code is a bit too fragile, yeah...
