The V4L2 M2M interface is simple: you open a video device and then you can
pass data to the hardware, it processes it and you get the processed data back.

The hardware just processes the data as fast as it can. Each time you open
the video device a new instance is created, and each instance can pass jobs
to the hardware.

Currently it is used for video scalers, deinterlacers, colorspace converters and
codecs, but in the end it is just data in, data out with some job scheduling (fifo)
towards the hardware. So supporting audio using the same core m2m framework wouldn't
be a big deal. We'd probably make a /dev/v4l-audio device for that.

It doesn't come for free: it is a new API, so besides adding support for it, it
also needs to be documented, we would need compliance tests, and very likely I
would want a new virtual driver for this (vim2m.c would be a good template).
