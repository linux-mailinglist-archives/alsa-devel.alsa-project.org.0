Hi Mark

Thank you for clearing the topics.
I think I could understand Rob and your expectation.

OK, let's cleanup the problem.

O : supported
- : not supported
x : Annotated

	simple-card
	 O: Normal connection
	 -: DPCM
	 -: Multi CPU/Codec
	 -: Codec2Codec

	audio-graph-card
(A)	 O: Normal connection
(B)	 x: DPCM
	 -: Multi CPU/Codec
	 -: Codec2Codec

	x: Tegra uses is as customize audio-graph-card

	audio-graph-card2
	 O: Normal connection
	 O: DPCM
	 O: Multi CPU/Codec
	 O: Codec2Codec

We need to keep simple-card, I think there is no discussion is needed here.

About audio-graph-card vs audio-graph-card2,
I think keeping (A) only on audio-graph-card2 is not super difficult
(But some message will be indicated. see below).
Supporting (B) on audio-graph-card2 is difficult.

I'm not sure detail, but we can do like this ?

	step 1)
	- add audio-graph-card2 which have (A) compatibility.
	- indicate "audio-graph-card will be deprecated" on audio-graph-card

	step 2)
	- Tegra switch to use audio-graph-card2
	- confirm that all existing audio-graph-card user have no problem on
	  audio-graph-card2 too.

	step 3)
	- remove audio-graph-card

My concerns are...

	- I'm not sure how DT is strict.
	  If we removed audio-graph-card, but user uses old Tegra DT on it...
	  We can't remove audio-graph-card forever if DT was super strict (?).

	- The naming of audio-graph-card vs audio-graph-card2 driver file.
	  because audio-graph-card will be removed later.

	- audio-graph-card2 can keep (A) compatible, but some features
	  are not recommended. Existing user will get such message.
	  And because of this compatibility, audio-graph-card2 can't remove
	  this "un-recommended" feature.

Thank you for your help !!

Best regards
