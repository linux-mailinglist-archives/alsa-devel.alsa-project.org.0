Ok, maybe I am mistaken, in most of the HDMI issues we've seen only one 
HDMI source.

But it's a good point that this is only supposed to be used for Intel 
whether it's a kernel parameter or a kcontrol shouldn't this be 
dependent on a PCI ID being detected and a SKYLAKE flag being set? it's 
my understanding that this applies from Skylake to TigerLake, not before.

I am not aware of such tools. The only thing I know is that some of the 
HDaudio power settings are already controlled by kernel parameters, e.g.

/etc/modprobe.d/audio_powersave.conf
options snd_hda_intel power_save=1
