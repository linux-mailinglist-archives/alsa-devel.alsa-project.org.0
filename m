The problem I'm feeling is that new card (= let's call it as card2 here) and
Sameer's posting "-cc-" are conflicted / no-compatibility.
It expands card1 DPCM detection.

The good things having "-cc-" is that he can use it immediately.
the bad things is that it is dificult to keep compatibility between "card1 + -cc-" and "card2".

Creating card2 for development purpose is very welcome for me, and card1 user :)
But after that, if we want to merge card1 and card2, we need to drop "-cc-" support unfortunately.
If we want to keep "-cc-", we need to have both card1 / card2.

So, how to handle it ?

Thank you for your help !!

Best regards
