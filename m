Yeah, unfortunately we have no reference, so the only chance would be
to test with another board that has a different setup.

A good point.  I checked the status now, and found that actually the
EQ and others won't appear in the normal playback / capture via HiFi
route, but only through DSP.  Since the normal usages with UCM profile
goes only via HiFi, EQ/DRC don't play any role.  So it's OK to remove
them, at least, for normal PC usages, as well as RPi HiFi extensions,
as it seems.

Takashi
