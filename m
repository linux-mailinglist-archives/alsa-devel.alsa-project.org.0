Hi Rojewski
Cc Pierre-Louis

Thank you for your review, explanation, feedback.

This patch-set moves from "legacy style" to "modern style",
[001] added glue code, and [146] removed "legacy style".
I believe this is needed to support more complex multiple connection device,
like multi-CPU / multi-Platform, etc, etc...

As Pierre-Louis said, unfortunately last patch removes "legacy style" from ALSA SoC.
I'm sorry to bother you, but, I / upstream can't care about out-of-tree code, unfortunately...

Thank you for your help !!
Best regards
