Humm, not really.

First, you're using this TIMEOUT_MS value in 3 unrelated places, and
using 2 different struct completion, which means there are side effects
beyond autoenumeration.

qcom.c-         /*

qcom.c-          * sleep for 10ms for MSM soundwire variant to allow
broadcast

qcom.c-          * command to complete.

qcom.c-          */

qcom.c-         ret = wait_for_completion_timeout(&swrm->broadcast,

qcom.c:                                   msecs_to_jiffies(TIMEOUT_MS));

--

qcom.c-         goto err_clk;

qcom.c- }

qcom.c-

qcom.c- qcom_swrm_init(ctrl);

qcom.c- wait_for_completion_timeout(&ctrl->enumeration,

qcom.c:                             msecs_to_jiffies(TIMEOUT_MS));

--

qcom.c-         if (!swrm_wait_for_frame_gen_enabled(ctrl))

qcom.c-                 dev_err(ctrl->dev, "link failed to connect\n");

qcom.c-

qcom.c-         /* wait for hw enumeration to complete */

qcom.c-         wait_for_completion_timeout(&ctrl->enumeration,

qcom.c:                                   msecs_to_jiffies(TIMEOUT_MS));


And then I don't get what you do on a timeout. in the enumeration part,
the timeout value is not checked for, so I guess enumeration proceeds
without the hardware being available? That seems to contradict the
assertion that you don't want to access registers before the hardware is
properly initialized.

And then on broadcast you have this error handling:

		ret = wait_for_completion_timeout(&swrm->broadcast,
						  msecs_to_jiffies(TIMEOUT_MS));
		if (!ret)
			ret = SDW_CMD_IGNORED;
		else
			ret = SDW_CMD_OK;

Which is equally confusing since SDW_CMD_IGNORED is really an error, and
the bus layer does not really handle it well - not to mention that I
vaguely recall the qcom hardware having its own definition of IGNORED?
