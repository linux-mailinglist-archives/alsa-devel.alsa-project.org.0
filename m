For USB, basically the snd-usb-audio USB audio class driver is the
place to start with.  Other USB audio drivers are very
device-specific, often the result of reverse engineering and might be
poorly supported.

Which actual card -- I don't know, honestly speaking, too.  There are
way too many devices in the market.
