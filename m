I guess the question here is how to identify the proper profile for a
certain platform and how to get it passed over the whole system.
Theoretically, the rename of the card name or mixer name strings could
be done in user-space side, too (e.g. mapping in alsa-lib or
whatever), so I don't think it mandatory to make them variable via
sysfs, if it's meant only for the consistency reason.

Didn't we discuss in the past about the possibility to store the
profile name in the card component string?


thanks,

Takashi
