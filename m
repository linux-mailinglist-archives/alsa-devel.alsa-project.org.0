Yes, and BIOS is always buggy, it's a fundamental rule of the world :)
So I'm not against adding the workaround itself.  The problem is that
applying the workaround globally would cause another regression.

Thanks.  We can reconsider to widen the application of the workaround
once when we see the requirement (i.e. more machines with buggy BIOS
setup.)
