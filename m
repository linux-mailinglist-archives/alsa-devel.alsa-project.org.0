Hi Mark

If you want to update current audio-graph-card without creating new
audio-graph-card2, I'm OK about it. But need adjusting / agreement.

Current audio-graph-card "DSP" user is only me, and I'm using it only locally.
Thus upstream doesn't get damage if I removed "audio-graph-scu-card"
(= DSP use case) support.

OTOH, Sameer is posting patch for "-cc-" support. If it was accepted
and he used it on upstream (= on tegra),
keeping compatibility will be very difficult and/or code will be very confusable.

If Sameer can OK and wait new audio-graph-card, maybe we have no compatibility issue.
But in such case, 1st version of new audio-graph-card might be not enough for him.
Sameer need to waiting / testing / adjusting / etc, etc...


Thank you for your help !!

Best regards
