So do you mean that the LED feature should be selectively enabled like
the current HD-audio?

What worried me is the plan to expose this capability to user-space.
If it's only a kernel-internal, we can fix it in the kernel and
nothing else broken, but if it's a part of API, that's not easy.

So, if any, I'd like to avoid exposing to the user-space at first.
(But then it comes to the question how to deal with a case like AMD
ACP...)
