Well, it's another side of coin.  With the current massive Kconfig and
ifdef, something can be overlooked pretty easily.  A randconfig may
catch it up, but this would be often after the commit.

But it's basically just a minor bikeshed thing.  However, the main
concern is: unless Intel stops producing a newer model, we'll go soon
beyond the amount of Kconfigs we can manage manually.

Usually splitting Kconfig items makes sense if -

- Functionality needs to be selective,
- It reduces the resultant code significantly, or
- Modules to be built can be chosen (and reduces memory footprint)

When looking at the current code, for example, I'm not sure which
category hits the case of Cometlake-S vs Cometlake-H vs
Cometlake-LP...

In short: I'd love to see if Kconfigs can be reduced as much as
possible.  It'll make our life easier for users, including distros, in
the end.


thanks,

Takashi
