It's OK from alsa-lib POV; although the uapi header change isn't 100%
safe, the user of this header is really our ones, so it's practically
acceptable, I suppose.

Could you submit the changes for kernel, so that it can be merged in
time?  Basically alsa-lib is synced with kernel, so the kernel should
be changed at first.
