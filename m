Hi Mark, Rob

We already have Audio-Graph-Card which is Of-Graph base general sound
card driver. Basically it supports basic CPU-Codec connection, and is
also supporting DPCM connection. Because it was forcibly expanded to
DPCM, DT parsing is very limited and very difficult to add new features
on it, for example Multi CPU/Codec support, Codec2Codec support, etc.

And some users want to use Audio-Graph-Card as basic connection and
expand its own settings on it.

This patch adds more flexible new Audio-Graph-Card2 driver for it.
Audio-Graph-Card and Audio-Graph-Card2 are similar, but don't have
full compatibility.

Audio-Graph-Card2 supports Normal Connection, DPCM Connection,
Multi CPU/Codec Connection, Codec2Codec Connection, and possible to
Customizing.

This patch-set adds Audio-Graph-Card2 driver and customized driver
sample, and DT settings sample which can be used for testing.

To enable testing/debuging, this patch-set also adds Test-Component
driver. We already have Dummy Component and/or Dummy DAI on soc-utils,
but 1) we can't use it from DT, 2) it do nothing.
Added new Test-Component can be used from DT, and it indicates called
function name. We can use it to trace callback order / understanding
ALSA SoC behavior, etc.
Sample DT settings which can be used for testing is using Test-Component.

This patch set includes sample DT for custome driver and/or
audio-graph-card2. You can easily try to use/test it if you added
below line to your DT file. It needs below CONFIGs.
It will probe sample Sound Card which has Normal/DPCM/Multi/Codec2Codec
connections.

	#include "../../../../../sound/soc/generic/audio-graph-card2-sample.dtsi"

	CONFIG_SND_AUDIO_GRAPH_CARD2
	CONFIG_SND_SAMPLE_CUSTOM_CARD
	CONFIG_SND_TEST_COMPONENT

There are some notes.

Because Audio Graph Card2 is still under experimental stage, it will
indicate such warning when probing, and the DT might be updated/exchanged.

It can use Codec2Codec, but it will start automatically when probed,
and can't stop it so far. It should be updated.

 1      : add Of-Graph *port base* loop which is used at Audio-Graph-Card2
 2 -  3 : add Test-Component driver
 4 - 10 : add Audio-Graph-Card2 driver
11      : add Audio-Graph-Card2 base custome driver sample
12 - 15 : Audio-Graph-Card2 driver / custome driver DT sample
