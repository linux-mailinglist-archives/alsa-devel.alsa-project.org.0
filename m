There is quite a lot communication over USB in both directions and I have to dig through the dumps. This would be a separate commit and I do not know, how long it could take.

Details are described here: <https://blog.frantovo.cz/c/387/>. The djm-fix tool is still a bit raw, but it works for me and at least one more DJM-250MK2 owner confirmed, that it works.

I haven't looked closely, but if it's about MIDI messaging, it can be
implemented in the kernel, too (only if it fits better than
user-space), yes.  If it's over HID, it's a different story, though.
