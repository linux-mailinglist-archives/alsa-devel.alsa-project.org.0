Ahh, OK, I see.
Indeed the dev which is used for CPU is used at soc-generic-dmaengine as Platform,
without indicating it at DT (= simple-card has "plat" support for platform at DT,
but audio-graph doesn't ).

I think key funciton is asoc_simple_canonicalize_platform().

This means we can revert this patch if needed, and yes it is needed :)
Could you please respawn the feature ? or I can do it if you want.

Thank you for your help !!

Best regards
