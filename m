[This email was generated by a script.  Let me know if you have any suggest=
ions
to make it better.]

Of the currently open syzbot reports against the upstream kernel, I've manu=
ally
marked 9 of them as possibly being bugs in the sound subsystem.  I've listed
these reports below, sorted by an algorithm that tries to list first the re=
ports
most likely to be still valid, important, and actionable.

Of these 9 bugs, 1 was bisected to a commit from the following person:

	Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

If you believe a bug is no longer valid, please close the syzbot report by
sending a '#syz fix', '#syz dup', or '#syz invalid' command in reply to the
original thread, as explained at https://goo.gl/tpsmEJ#status

If you believe I misattributed a bug to the sound subsystem, please let me =
know,
and if possible forward the report to the correct people or mailing list.

Here are the bugs:
