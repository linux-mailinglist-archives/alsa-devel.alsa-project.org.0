The patch

   dt-bindings: sound: convert rockchip i2s bindings to yaml

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: sound: convert rockchip i2s bindings to yaml

Current dts files with 'i2s' nodes are manually verified.
In order to automate this process rockchip-i2s.txt
has to be converted to yaml.

-- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
-  region.
-- interrupts: should contain the I2S interrupt.
-- dmas: DMA specifiers for tx and rx dma. See the DMA client binding,
-	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
-- dma-names: should include "tx" and "rx".
-- clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifer pairs, one for each entry in clock-names.
-- clock-names: should contain the following:
-   - "i2s_hclk": clock for I2S BUS
-   - "i2s_clk" : clock for I2S controller
-- rockchip,playback-channels: max playback channels, if not set, 8 channels default.
-- rockchip,capture-channels: max capture channels, if not set, 2 channels default.
-
-Required properties for controller which support multi channels
