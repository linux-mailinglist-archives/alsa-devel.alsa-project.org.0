I still don't understand how non-zero codec_mask is passed.
The non-zero codec_mask means that BIOS or whatever believes that
HD-audio codecs are present and let HD-audio controller reporting the
presence.  What error did you get at probing?

It's a sort of must, as the module loading is involved with binding
with the codecs, as well as (optionally) request_firmware()
invocation.
