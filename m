It seems that there are some assumptions. I will try to address some things:

You can enable/use multiple modifiers per device.

The modifiers may define extra PCM streams in the standard Value section - you 
can use CapturePCM value for the modifier like "Echo Reference". Modifiers may 
alter the characteristics of the original UCM device stream (using command 
sequences), too.

Modifiers are an extra layer on top of devices. I don't think that we have any 
default relation between the modifier PCM device and the original PCM device 
(from the UCM device definition). A new value to describe this (like 
"ReplacePlaybackPCM 1") may be introduced. Another issue is when multiple 
modifiers with this description are active - they conflict, so it should be 
described somewhere, too. Perhaps, "ConflictingModifier" array may be added to 
API. But those extensions are not required for the "Echo Reference" modifier.
