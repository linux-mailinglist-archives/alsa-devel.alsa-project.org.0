It depends on how new driver was implemented.
If we need to keep current card, I will keep it as-is and do nothing anymore,
and has customize option at card2.
If we update current card, customize option will be added to it.

The biggest issue on current audio-graph-card is that
DPCM feature is limited, and because of it, the link detection
is very tricky.
Your "-cc-" assumes all links are DPCM, but it is more limitation.
We want to have more flexible/generic detection.

This compatible is used just for indicating audio-graph DSP.
"audio-graph-card" will parse it if it was connected.
If you confuse it, just ignore for now.


Thank you for your help !!
