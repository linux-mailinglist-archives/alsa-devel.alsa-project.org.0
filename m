Hi David, Takashi,
We're looking into supporting some of these older devices at the moment, 
and have a patch chain in development at the moment.
The approach we've taken is a lot closer to the one taken by the github 
Luke links through to elsewhere in this chain, which we think might be a 
cleaner approach.Â  We do have concerns about the current approach of 
identifying the SPI device though, as we've seen "spi1" become "spi2" as 
additional devices become supported in the kernel and more SPI 
controllers come into use.Â  We'll look into this more and hopefully get 
a patch chain up in the coming weeks.
This patch chain looks like it might also be missing support for 
different boost configurations.
I wouldn't recommend this patch be merged.
Thanks,
Stu
