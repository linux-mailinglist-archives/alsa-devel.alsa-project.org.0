IMO, the only and the most important point is whether it works as-is
without changing the existing user-space, or exactly what scenario
would be broken.  If the breakage is significant, we may introduce a
Kconfig, as you suggested.

I don't think the mixer contents change are problematic.  In the case
of HDMI/DP, it's mostly read-only for fetching ELD or jack state.

Other than that, I like the idea, the code change looks simple
enough, and it'd make maintenance easier.


thanks,

Takashi
