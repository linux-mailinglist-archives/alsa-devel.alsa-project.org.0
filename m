It's rather difficult to follow these changes and error reports buried
in email report sent on a Sunday of a three-day week-end for me.
I also had additional errors not reported,

[   36.125113] kernel: rt286 i2c-INT343A:00: ASoC: unknown pin HV
[   36.125128] kernel: rt286 i2c-INT343A:00: ASoC: unknown pin VREF
[   36.125130] kernel: rt286 i2c-INT343A:00: ASoC: unknown pin LDO1
[   36.125921] kernel: rt286 i2c-INT343A:00: ASoC: DAPM unknown pin LDO1

it's unclear to me why a dailink change in a machine driver would cause
such codec-side issues.

If the changes in this 17-patch series need to be tied to a framework
fix, you have to make the dependencies explicit and better yet provide a
self-contained patch series that does not introduce a temporary
regression, or introduce the framework change first and clearly describe
the dependency in a longer Broadwell-specific patchset. This is an 8-yr
old device, it shouldn't be that hard.
