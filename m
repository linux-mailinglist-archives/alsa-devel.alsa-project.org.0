Power management for the Atom/sst stuff is far from clear for me, it 
uses .prepare/.complete callbacks where 
snd_soc_suspend()/poweroff()/resume() are invoked, so there's a bit of 
confusion IMO between that the framework does and what the driver should do.

It's also unclear to me why the INFO_RESUME flag was set, since the 
driver cannot restart from the same position.

I would try and triangulate with the more traditional bytcr-rt5640, to 
rule out a codec-specific or machine driver issue (handling of rt5645 
and 5672 was done by different people and the machine driver is quite 
different).

I would also remove the INFO_RESUME, that will force the ALSA core to 
call the .prepare steps and maybe restore settings that are not applied 
with the current resume.

Either way, it's a bit of a shot in the dark :-(

My 2 cents
