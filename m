The best is to ask your distro.  It's a distro kernel, and we have no
idea what's missing and what's fixed, after all.

But, if you can just test 5.6.y kernel while keeping the rest of your
system, and it still shows the same problem, then it becomes more
interesting to us.  Installing and testing a new kernel takes only a
couple of minutes.  Any reason to hesitate to do it so much...?


thanks,

Takashi
