I am very very far from confident we can guarantee that will be
present in the ACPI. The ACPI is typically made for and by the
Windows side.

I really think if we want to start doing things that way on ACPI
platforms someone with a little more clout than us needs to start
doing it first. If Intel or someone was doing it that way it
might give us a little more levelage to push it as being the
"correct" way to do it.

I will switch to the callback, but really don't think we can rely
on this being in DSD yet.

Yeah happy enough to use devm_ here, just didn't know it existed
and wanted to better understand your concerns as I was having
difficulty seeing the issue.

Thanks,
