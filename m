Interesting.  3 seconds are too long, but I guess 1 second would work
as well?

In anyway, the success with a long delay means that the sound setup
after the full runtime resume of GPU seems working.

Yes, please take the snapshot before plugging, right after plugging
and right after enabling.  I'm not sure whether your monitor supports
the audio, and ELD contents should show that, at least.
