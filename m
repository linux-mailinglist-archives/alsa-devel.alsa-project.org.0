Now I'm reading the code again.  Is it about the put_device() in
snd_hdac_ext_bus_device_remove()?

void snd_hdac_ext_bus_device_remove(struct hdac_bus *bus)
{
	struct hdac_device *codec, *__codec;
	/*
	 * we need to remove all the codec devices objects created in the
	 * snd_hdac_ext_bus_device_init
	 */
	list_for_each_entry_safe(codec, __codec, &bus->codec_list, list) {
		snd_hdac_device_unregister(codec);
		put_device(&codec->dev);
	}
}

I don't figure out why put_device() is needed at this place...
