Judging from the link, is it controlled through HID?  If so, it's
primarily done by a HID driver, and it doesn't belong to the sound
card stuff, so far.
Though....

... given that it's implemented in a HID driver, the integration to
the system is a different question.  But unless it's implemented as a
sound card device, the rest will become a totally different,
e.g. another PA or PW module.
