Right.  The Kconfig of Intel audio is already too messy even for now.
We don't want more complexity just for covering some very corner
case.

Practically seen, if SOF Kconfig is enabled, we may assume that SOF is
preferred in general.  I don't think of any big need of yet another
static configuration.

The legacy HD-audio stuff is resolved with the recent DMIC detection
on 5.4, I suppose?

Well, one question is where to put this option.  I thought of HD-audio
core in the past, but it's not always the common place any longer.
We may introduce yet another common module just for an option, but it
sounds little appealing to me in comparison with the needed
resources.

Basically the deployment of SST is only for the already existing
devices, and all newer should go for SOF.  And, the pattern Pierre
mentioned should cover almost all use cases.  This made me believing
that a simple switch is no mandatory request.

In anyway, Jaroslav's patch looks like a good starting point.  We can
build up a few more exceptions (SKl/KBl/APL Chromebooks with DMIC) on
top of it, then we've done mostly, right?


thanks,

Takashi
