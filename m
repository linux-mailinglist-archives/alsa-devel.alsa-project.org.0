I understand is that naming is difficult, but a rich-graph-card sounds a
bit awkward?
Will we see a wealthy-graph-card if the rich is not resourceful enough? ;)

The current generation of graph based generic audio card is
audio-graph-card

This is going to be an (incompatible) evolution, the Next/New
Generation. Would it sound better if it is named
audio-graph-card-ng / ng-audio-graph-card

The 'rich' sound really out of place (if not rich then poor?).

Next Generation, New Generation, Extended, etc
or just drop the graph and
generic-audio-card
