Actually the patch looks like an overkill by adding the FE stream lock
at every loop, and this caused the problem, AFAIU.

Basically we need to protect the link addition / deletion while the
list traversal (there is a need for protection of BE vs BE access
race, but that's a different code path).  For the normal cases, it
seems already protected by card->pcm_mutex, but the problem is the FE
trigger case.  It was attempted by dpcm_lock, but that failed because
it couldn't be applied properly there.

That said, what we'd need is only:
- Drop dpcm_lock codes once
- Put FE stream lock around dpcm_be_connect() and dpcm_be_disconnect()

That should suffice for the race at trigger.  The FE stream lock is
already taken at trigger callback, and the rest list addition /
deletion are called from different code paths without stream locks, so
the explicit FE stream lock is needed there.

In addition, a lock around dpcm_show_state() might be needed to be
replaced with card->pcm_mutex, and we may need to revisit whether all
other paths take card->pcm_mutex.

Also, BE-vs-BE race can be protected by taking a BE lock inside
dpcm_be_dai_trigger().
