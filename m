Actually in the very early version of msecs_to_jiffies() was all
inlined, so the compiler could optimize such a case, I guess.  Now it
was factored out to an external function in commit ca42aaf0c861, so it
became difficult.

Well, comparing with the expanded result doesn't make always sense.
With such a logic, you can argue why BIT(x) macro is needed, too.
After all, it's a matter of semantics.

That's my question, too -- whether the open code is preferred for this
particular purpose.
