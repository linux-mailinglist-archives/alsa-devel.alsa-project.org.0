Right.

It's not so trivial to extend.  The logic of driver parser assumes the
single purpose pins, and if they appear doubly, the behavior becomes
confusing.  For example, if you just add the same pin to both
speaker_pins[] and hp_pins[], all speaker_pins[] get muted by the
auto-mute, hence you'll mute the headphone again.  OTOH, if you don't
list up the pin in speaker_pins[], it won't be used for speakers for
multi-channels, obviously.

We can give it a try.  If it doesn't work as expected, we'd need more
extension in the driver side.

Check rather "Speaker Surround Jack" state upon plugging the
headphone.  Does it change reliably?

Note that even if you set such flags manually like the above, it won't
work, because of the reasons I already mentioned.

Actually this must be paired with the corresponding bit of GPIO_DATA,
too.  Is the bit 0x02 of GPIO_DATA set or cleared?  Usually setting it
turns on the amp, but sometimes inverted.

It's usually just the external amp controlled via GPIO, and the signal
must go through the pin 0x18 as well as the center channel, I suppose.
