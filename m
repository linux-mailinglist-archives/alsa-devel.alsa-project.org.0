Ouch, this kind of information has to be mentioned in the patch
description.  Otherwise one would take only this series and face a
problem easily.  I can imagine such a problem on the stable tree.

Sure, it doesn't sound right, either.

Can we then add DAPM widgets and routes later conditionally instead of
having it in component driver definition?
