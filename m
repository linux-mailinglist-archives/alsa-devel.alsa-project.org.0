So you want to avoid the dependency on snd-hda-core if the system is
with only I2S/DMIC?

But, snd-sof-intel-hda-common already has the hard dependency on
snd-hda-core if CONFIG_SND_SOC_SOF_HDA is enabled.  So the attempt
makes little sense as long as CONFIG_SND_SOC_SOF_HDA is set.

And, if CONFIG_SND_SOC_SOF_HDA isn't set -- i.e.
CONFIG_SND_SOC_HF_HDA_LINK isn't set either; it implies that there can
be no user of HD-audio bus.  So, I see no big reason we need to care
about the stuff...

Yes, but this is a kind of layer violation.  Imagine you do initialize
the struct pci_dev or whatever else device object because you want to
reduce the dependency on other core helpers; it would be nightmare
from the maintenance POV.

I've had already hard time to figure out why SOF HDA initializes the
HD-audio bus, because it misses the explicit snd_hdac_*_bus_init()
call.  That's the starting point of this thread.

So, let's avoid ugly hacks.  Make it more straightforward.  Again, if
the module size matters, we can split and reduce the part of HD-audio
core stuff that is directly linked to SOF core.
