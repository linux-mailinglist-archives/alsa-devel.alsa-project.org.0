The code change itself looks OK.  Could you prepare the proper patch
that is applied to kernel git tree and resubmit?  It needs to be a
patch file that is directly applicable via git-am.  Please put the
explanation above in the changelog.  Also it'd be good to put the
comment concisely as well.

Last but not least, don't forget to put your signed-off-by line, too.


thanks,

Takashi
