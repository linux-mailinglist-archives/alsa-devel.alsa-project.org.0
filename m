Hello Ruben,

I don't see your point here. I mentioned not being in academia myself
but last time I was, the academics, from the most junior to the most
seasoned scholar, are writing for journals. They are writing to get
published and cited hopefully.

If they were writing for their dean or mentor to grade them, that would
be called homework. While that's arguably part of education, higher
or otherwise, Muni Sekhar certainly did not ask for help with his
homework.

I do have my gripes with higher education and I never suggested I
understood it.

As to contacting the maintainer precisely of the part of the kernel you
want to contribute (ALSA kernel-side for Muni Sekhar in this case)
before actually contributing any code, this sounds, at least to me,
like sensible advice.

Thank you,
