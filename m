Read again what I have written. Having to expose a device-specific API
for endpoint drivers to obtain their interrupts, and requiring them to
know about some magic values that describe the interrupts source are
not a acceptable constructs.

We have firmware descriptions to expose interrupt linkages, and your
HW is not special enough to deserve its own top level API. Yes, we
accepted such drivers in the past, but it has to stop.

Either you describe the internal structure of your device in DT or
ACPI, and make all client drivers use the standard API, or you make
this a codec library, purely specific to your device and only used by
it. But the current shape is not something I'm prepared to accept.
