OK.  It's indeed awkward to mix up both auto-tools and meson.
So the more suitable option would be either to modernize everything
with meson, or just create a configure.ac for efw-downloader.
Maybe the latter is easier, as the dependency would be only about
hinawa and the check via pkgconfig is trivial even with automake.
But, obviously, modernization is more appealing (with a risk of
breakage, as always :)


thanks,

Takashi
