The problem with this model is that, in particular in the case of
speaker amps, incorrect settings can cause your speakers to blow up.
This has been a longstanding problem with ASoC platforms (I should know,
I *melted* the speakers in a Chromebook by toggling the wrong alsamixer
control once, it even warped the external case, all without making any
audible noise).

It's the kernel's job to ensure that broadly exposed user controls are
safe and cannot be used to cause hardware damage; if that is possible,
then that's a kernel security vulnerability worthy of a CVE, in my
opinion. I think this idea of exposing what is effectively raw codec
chip registers as ALSA controls that is so popular these days was a
terrible idea from the start, and only makes some sense within the world
of highly integrated vendor-controlled embedded platforms running
kiosk-style software with no user control. It is completely unsuitable
for a desktop Linux system, since it means users *will* destroy their
hardware accidentally. So, some way or another, whatever is exposed has
to be sanitized so that it can't go outside the envelope of what is safe
for the hardware design. That cannot be known at the level of codec
chips and speaker amp chips; it requires platform integration knowledge.

That knowledge is what is (intended to be) encoded in the macaudio
driver. It's supposed to know how to drive the underlying codec chips
and disable access to things that don't make any sense on the platform,
and expose controls to the user that are reasonable for what a user
would want to do on that specific hardware platform, and no more.
