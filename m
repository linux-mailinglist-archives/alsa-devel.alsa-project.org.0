Heh, it was our luck that we've worked on the similar problem very
recently.

I think many devices require the implicit feedback seem following this
pattern: for such devices, the full-duplex streams are mandatory,
i.e. both streams have to be started always.  And the implicit
feedback is triggered at the later point for a proper sync.

As mentioned previously, it might be the difference of the PCM
parameters to be deployed.  I guess Geraldo didn't test speaker-test
program but maybe only the standard sound backends like JACK, etc.

In anyway, I'm going to format and submit the proper patch for
merging.
