OK.  So this must be for a specific new use case...

Right, that'll become a compatibility headache.

Hm, right, mmap is messy.

Hmm.  Reading more about those restrictions and requirements, I feel
that this might be better implemented in the gadget driver side
locally at first.  Basically we can handle similarly: add a new local
flag, set it at the stream stop, and return an error at prepare until
hw_params gets reconfigured.  This might be even smaller changes?


thanks,

Takashi
