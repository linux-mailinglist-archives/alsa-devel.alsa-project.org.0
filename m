It's not obvious unless you read the code changes.  Not obvious
whether it's a code refactoring without any functional change, etc.
Such info can be well put in the patch description.

Right, it was enough for me to reply the same thing again, so I wanted
just to reduce the pile of XXXX.  I'd reject all at the next time :)
