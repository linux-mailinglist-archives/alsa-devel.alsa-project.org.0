I'd like to get a comment from kselftest people about this addition
with the external alsa-lib.  Shua, what do you think?

If it's acceptable, I'd happily take the v2 patch and Sakamoto-san's
additional fix to sound.git tree.

This comes to the question again to the test with external libraries,
IMO.  If a self-contained test code is much preferred, we can go for
implementing open-code with raw kernel ABI.  The control API is
relatively simple and fairly solid over years, hence it's likely
feasible.  OTOH, using alsa-lib is also showing the test with the
actual use case, and in that sense, it's not bad at all as more
practical tests.


thanks,

Takashi
