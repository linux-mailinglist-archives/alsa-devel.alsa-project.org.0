I guess you've already tried to pass the model option, but judging
from the alsa-info.sh output, you passed it wrongly.  As the onboard
analog output is from the AMD HD-audio controller that is the
secondary card (while the primary card is Nvidia HDMI), you'd need to
pass "model=,XXX" (see the comma before "XXX"), i.e. set in the second
entry of the array.
