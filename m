IMO, this is a hard part.  It's possible that user (or the system)
wants two different scenarios:
- LED indicates the built-in mic mute
- LED indicates the mute state of the currently used input

The current code assumes the latter case, and that might conflict with
the concept of Dell privacy stuff (as the built-in mic is still
allowed while using the headset).

How would be a good way to switch to a different scenario?
