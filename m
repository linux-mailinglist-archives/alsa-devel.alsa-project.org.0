Well, a patch is basically for patching -- i.e. fixing / correcting
the stuff.  For the basic API design topic, you could start off a
thread, not as a form of a patch.

I don't mean that the current API is the best form, either.
OTOH, it's been used for very long time, and the history tells that
it's "good enough".

The backward compatibility isn't really easy as you wrote, I'm
afraid.  If you run an old user-space stuff on the new kernel, you
must not fill that new information bit but translate it to the string
suffix instead; and that has to be done inside the kernel
automagically.
