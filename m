I suppose it's not only about PA, but in general we need to define how
to deal with it.  I can imagine to provide a UCM profile that is
mapped to some dummy ops for the slave card, for example.

FWIW, I see a similar requirement for the recent change in USB-audio
for Gigabyte Auros Master with AMD TRX40: it provides a front
headphone output from a separate card while other I/Os are served by
another card.  It'd be handy if both can be combined.
