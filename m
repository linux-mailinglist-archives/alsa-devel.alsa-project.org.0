Hi Mark

Thank you for your feedback

Thanks. It is a little bit long name, so,
rich-graph-card, or rich-link-card is nice for me.

I guess/hope the DT issue will be disappear if new card can keep
existing binding...

Ohhhh, yes, indeed. I didn't notice about that !
If my understanding was correct, it can be something like ...

	card {
		compatible = "rich-graph-card";
		...
		links = ...
		
		mix {
			...
		}
		multi {
			...
		}
		codec2codec {
			...
		}
	}

Hmm, nice idea.

It is possible in my understanding, but am I misunderstanding ?

... is it naming issue ?
In my understanding, both "DSP" and "MIXer" are using "DPCM" connection,
but driver/sample is calling it as "DSP".
I think "MIXer" and "Codec2Codec" in same card is possible.
I'm not sure about "DSP" case...

Thank you for your help !!

Best regards
