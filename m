The patch won't work with the latest ALSA timer code found in my
for-next branch due to the API changes.  Essentially you need to
rewrite as:
	timeri = snd_timer_instance_new(...);
	if (!timeri)
		no_memory_error;
	timeri->flags |= ...;
	timeri->ccallback = ...;
	....
	err = snd_timer_open(timeri, ....);
	if (err < 0)
		error;


thanks,

Takashi
