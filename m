OK, but the problem is still same.  The basic problem is that the
hda_codec_driver_probe() is called for the hda_codec object that
hasn't been initialized and bypasses to ext_ops.hdev_attach.

So, we can factor out the fundamental part of
snd_hda_codec_device_new() that is irrelevant with the card object and
call it in hdac_hda_dev_probe().  Most of the legacy HD-audio codec
can work without the card object, including suspend/resume.

But this will be a more intensive surgery, and maybe not much worth
for the corner case, so I already applied your patch as is.


thanks,

Takashi
