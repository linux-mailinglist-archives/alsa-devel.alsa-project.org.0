Right, hence the second part of the question - the general thing for
drivers has just been to assume that the power might've gone out over
suspend and behave as though it did unless we were using the device as a
wake source.  We could if required extend the existing regulator API
notification stuff to generate notifications, though they'd not work
when it's compiled out.

(note BTW that at the point I queried the performance thing I'd not got
as far as the magic bypassed write sequences)

So this is clearly a being done at the wrong level - it is needlessly
complex, non-idiomatic and making fragile and non-obvious assumptions
about how the cache code operates.  The issue you've got is that the
cache code is presenting interfaces for the common case where you'd only
want to resync the cache in cases where the device has been reset but
you've added code which bypasses the cache and pulls the device out of
sync with the cache.  You need to teach regmap about that, not try to
hack around things in the driver code.  But...

=2E..that's based on the assumption that this is all about the magic write
sequences you're using for shutdown potentially conflicting with default
values you've got in the cache?  If it's not those then the assumption
is that either the device was reset in which case it has reset values or
the device was not reset and held it's previous value, in which case the
cache sync is redundant.  If we don't trust the device to reset cleanly
for some reason then it's probably a bad idea to tell regmap about
default values in the first place since even on initial boot we might
actually be doing a soft reboot and the device could be holding values
=66rom whatever was running beforehand.

This clearly isn't simple, and other than those shutdown sequences or
potential issues with the device not resetting cleanly this should be
done by extending regmap so it explicitly knows what's going on.  If it
is those shutdown sequences then you're probably looking for something
like doing a _sync_region() on the registers the sequences touch.
Possibly a _sync_region() variant that writes everything requested, or
just make sync_region() not skip defaults.  Or just remove all the
defaults from the driver, the sync will be a bit more expensive but
that's hopefully fine.  If it's not those shutdown sequences it should
still be handled genericly but I'd really like to understand the
scenario you're concerned about here, especially the fact that any issue
will show up in this single register that the code is checking.

Hrm, that may have changed since I last looked - if that's the case then
I guess it's best not to warn which was what I was thinking here.

Well, apparently it doesn't since otherwise we could just do a resync.

What about the shutdown sequence - does that not touch cached registers?

Right, but the point here is that coming out of suspend the driver is
expected to be unconditionally marking the cache as dirty and doing a
resync since we probably lost power.  The code is trying to avoid that
for reasons that are not at all apparent but I *think* are due to the
bypassed writes in shutdown(), especially if you say it's not a
performance thing.  We shouldn't need to worry about there being non
default states in the hardware.

The whole thing is just really confusing as it stands.  Like I say I
think this needs to express what it's trying to do clearly in both the
regmap operations it's doing and the code in general, at the minute it's
not clear looking at things what the goal is.
