To be honest, I don't think this version will be final version of
Generic audio card driver.
We will want to have more advanced generic audio card if framework was updated,
and/or new feature was added, and/or want to use more complex connection,
etc, etc, etc...

In such case, because of Device-Tree, it is very difficult to update driver
with keeping compatibility.
This means, we need to keep old version generic audio card as-is,
and add new generic audio card, like this version.

New / Next / Extended / Rich are not best naming IMO.
For example, we will confuse if we add new generic audio card at
10 years later (It should be more new/next/extended/rich than this version).

And yes, people should not feel bad from driver naming.

Thus, my honest opinion is that using v2, v3, ... is easy to understand,
especially for audio-graph-card. (audio-graph-card2, audio-graph-card3, ...)

But, any naming is very welcome for me if Mark and/or all people are accepted.

Thank you for your help !!

Best regards
