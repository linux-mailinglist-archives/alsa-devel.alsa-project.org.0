If you mean really snd_device_new() calls generically, not specific to
snd_hda_codec_device_new() -- then no, something must be wrong.

And even for snd_hda_codec_device_new(), I'm not sure about it.

Actually, who decrements the device refcount at which timing...?
It'd be helpful if you can clarify it, then we might see a better
solution or a better explanation.
