Yes, but remember that they adapt how the existing code behaves; so
even if EBUSY might appears like a better fit, a different error code
may bring unexpected outcome.  User space programs can do every crazy
thing, so never underestimate a subtle change if it's visible --
that's what I've learned from the long development history.
Especially true, if the stuff is a very old one like this.

That said, I wouldn't mind changing if it's about a new driver code.
But this isn't such a case.

So my take is rather to skip this.
