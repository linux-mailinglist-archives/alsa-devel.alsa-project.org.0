And at this point it's already something wrong.  We need to check why
SNDRV_CTL_POWER_D3hot is kept there, instead of working around the
rest behavior.

If a running PCM stream has been suspended, the stream needs to be
resumed manually by user-space.  There is no automatic resume.  You
can forget about it and skip scratching that surface.

Again, the point to be checked is why D3hot is kept after
snd_usb_autoresume() is called.

It's Android, and I wonder whether the system does the system-suspend
(S3), or it's all runtime PM?  Basically D3hot is set only for the
former, the system suspend, where the driver's PM callback is called
with PMSG_SUSPEND.  Please check this at first.  That is,
usb_audio_suspend() receives PMSG_SUSPEND or such, which makes
chip->autosuspended=1.  The D3hot flag is set only in this condition.

Then, check the resume patterns.  The usb-audio suspend/resume has
multiple refcounts.  One is the Linux device PM refcount, and
chip->active refcount, and chip->num_suspended_intf refcount.

The first one (PM refount) is the primary refcount to manage the whole
system, and this is incremented / decremented by the standard PM
calls.  The second one, chip->active, is a temporary flag to avoid the
re-entrance of the PM callbacks, and incremented at the probe enter
and __usb_audio_resume(), and decremented at the probe exit and
__usb_audio_resume() exist.  The last one, chip->num_suspended_intf is
a refcount for the multiple interfaces assigned to a single card.

And, the most suspicious case is the last one,
chip->num_suspended-intf.  It means that the device has multiple
USB interfaces and they went to suspend, while the resume isn't
performed for the all suspended interfaces in return.

If that's the case, you need to check where the suspend gets called to
which USB-interface (and which pm_message_t) and whether the resume
gets called for those.


thanks,

Takashi
