Yes, you'd need to have a suspend/resume PM callback in the driver
that flips the internal flag to invalidate the hw_parmas, and in the
prepare callback, just call hw_params(NULL) if that flag is set.

The hardware drivers do a lot of more things in either suspend/resume
PM callbacks or prepare callback for re-setup of the hardware.  We can
follow the similar pattern.  Heavy-lifting works in the trigger
callbacks is really something to avoid.
