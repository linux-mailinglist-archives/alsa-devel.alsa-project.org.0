As the early patch does, creating a kernel control (but not a generic
"Capture" switch but specific to LED) and control it in UCM profile.
What's the practical problem there?  That's what I might have missed
as the starting point of the discussion.

You can create up to 1028 user controls per card and each of them can
fire the led trigger...  That's an interesting experiment :)

So far, a user control is merely storing the value, let read/write via
the control API.  That's all, and nothing wrong can happen just by
that.  Now if it interacts with other subsystem...

A more serious concern is rather the fragility of the setup; for
enabling the mute LED control, you'd have to create a new user-space
control, the function of the control has to be ignored by some
application and some not, etc.  This has to be done on each machine
when the system got updated.  And, not everyone is using alsa-lib.
Does tiny ALSA and other existing backend support the user control
element management?  Some uncertainty here.


thanks,

Takashi
