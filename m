I think the basic concept is OK.  Maybe we want to have a Kconfig to
enable/disable this feature for users who want a slim kernel.

And, it'd be better to reorganize the series.  It's not necessarily
incremental form; e.g. patch 2 doesn't have to be an individual
patch.

I'll take a deeper look for each patch, too.


thanks,

Takashi
