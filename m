Thanks, that's what I missed from the big picture.

Hm, that would certainly work, but as we discussed before, it enforces
the softvol PCM process for PA.  That isn't too bad for the capture,
fortunately, but not ideal, OTOH.

And, I'm not sure how PA can take any control as its main capture mute
switch, if it's named differently.  Wouldn't we need to change mixer
path in PA as well?  And, if we may change PA side, it sounds more
natural to change a control directly in PA's mixer path.  The softvol
doesn't fit well with PA, after all.

If we have to go in this way, that's an acceptable name, I think.


thanks,
