OK, right, this fix is needed no matter whether to take my other
change to skip hda_widget_sysfs_init() call in
hda_widget_sysfs_reinit().

... this doesn't look better from consistency POV.  The whole code in
hdac_sysfs.c doesn't take any lock in itself.  The protection is
supposed to be done in the caller side.  So, let's keep as is now.

Also...

There is no need of two mutex_unlock() here.  They can be unified,

  	codec->num_nodes = nums;
  	codec->start_nid = start_nid;
  	codec->end_nid = start_nid + nums;
  unlock:
	mutex_unlock(&codec->widget_lock);
  	return err;

Could you refresh this and resubmit?


thanks,

Takashi
