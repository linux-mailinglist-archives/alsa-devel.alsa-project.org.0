Hi Mark, Pierre-Louis

If my understanding was correct,
Lars-Peter's presentation at ELCE was using idea of "Bridge".
This idea is not exist in current ALSA SoC,
but current DAI can be updated to it ?
Then, current notion can be udated also?
I'm not 100% understanding how to update,
how to use, etc, but my Image is...

	sink     source
	+---+	 +---+
	|DAI|--->|DAI|
	+---+	 +---+

	    ---->
	+------------+
	|   Bridge   |
	+------------+

Thank you for your help !!

Best regards
