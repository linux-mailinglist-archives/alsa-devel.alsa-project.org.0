The problem, as stated a few e-mails earlier, is that the HDA errors 
currently prevent snd_hda_intel from properly probing the device and 
registering it with vgaswitcheroo. As a result, the GPU always stays in 
DynPwr rather than DynOff even when it's unused, keeping the PCIe bus 
and the CPU package powered. Basically burning through a charged battery 
a lot quicker than need be.
If we go back a mile on the e-mail thread, I think the problem was 
narrowed down to snd_hda_intel reading an invalid codec mask on the 
config space, and using it anyway. That being said, I believe there are 
also reports of users that don't get HDMI audio unless the cable was 
plugged in at boot-time, with similar messages in their logs. The codec 
might in such cases be hiding themselves until a cable is plugged in?
@Aaron Plattner: does that latter observation sound right to you?

Right. Are there situations where nouveau needs to? Or is this a 
misunderstanding of the problem from my end?
