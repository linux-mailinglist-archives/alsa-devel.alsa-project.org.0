It's just a name string :)  Realtek seems to give a different chip
name for the certain variant for Dell or whatever big vendors.
AFAIK, basically it's the very same chip as ALC670, which is almost
compatible with ALC662 variant.

The datasheet of ALC662 and similar chips should be available.
In general, there is no big difference among Realtek chips; one has
more I/O pins available, while one has less.

The vendor-specific stuff like COEF isn't found in the datasheet in
details, unfortunately.  Also, the GPIO pin connection isn't covered
by the codec datasheet, as it's rather device-specific, of course.


HTH,

Takashi
