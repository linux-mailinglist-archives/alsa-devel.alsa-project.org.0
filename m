Well, but the allocation itself is dynamic for DP-MST, even on Intel,
so user can't expect the completely persistent index assignment.
That's the reason I took Nikhil's patch (even I suggested to simplify
in that way).

We had a trick to assign the primary index.  It still works, right?
That should be the only concern.

This is a platform-specific part, and on Intel, the assumption has
been that pipe is equivalent with dev_id.  If this changed, of course,
we must reconsider the whole picture.

For generic_acomp_pin_eld_notify(), it's gfx-driver specific, too.
And currently dev_id = -1 in AMDGPU, so we don't think too much about
the behavior compatibility.

Yeah, that's a bit messy.  The only expectation is the primary slot
assignment -- i.e. the case only one monitor is connected.  As long as
this behavior is kept, I don't think any big problem with the dynamic
assignment.

Since the assignment should work with your patch somehow, I already
applied it.  Let's do fine tune-up during 5.5 rc cycles, if any.


thanks,
